# Akinator

Welcome to the Java Akinator-like game project! 
This project was developed to create a game inspired by Akinator, with a unique feature: the game's ability to learn and adapt with each playthrough.
Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, Binary Trees, and File Processing techniques, 
this project aims to provide an interactive and adaptive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Adaptive Character Guessing:** The game utilizes Binary Trees to efficiently guess characters based on user responses. With each playthrough, the game learns and adapts its guessing strategy, providing a more personalized experience.

- **Modular and Maintainable Codebase:** The project is built with a focus on OOP, resulting in a modular and maintainable codebase. This makes it easy to extend or enhance the game's functionality in the future.

- **Dynamic Character Knowledge Base:** Through File Processing techniques, the game dynamically expands its character knowledge base over time. This ensures that the game remains engaging and up-to-date with new character information.
